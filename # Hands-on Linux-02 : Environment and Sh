# Hands-on Linux-02 : Environment and Shell Variables


## Part 1 - Environment Variables vs. Shell Variables
​
- Examine the Difference between "env" and "printenv" commands
  
- Usage notes
```txt
Only one name argument can be specified.
printenv SOMENAME is equivalent to echo $SOMENAME for exported variables.
printenv without any arguments is functionally equivalent to `env` without any arguments

Exit values
0
Successful completion
1
Failure due to one of the following:
More than one environment variable was specified
An option was specified (printenv has no options)
```​

- To understand the diferences apply the all lines below one by one   

```bash
env
printenv
printenv HOME
echo $HOME
env HOME
```
​
- Understanding the shell variable. The `set` command is used for printing the SHELL variables
​
```bash
TECHPRO=education
env
set
set | grep TECHPRO
echo $TECHPRO
```
​
- Understanding the environment variable. Use export command.
​
```bash
export PRO=TECHPRO
env
```
​
- Difference between shell and environment variables. Create a user, name it "mike", switch to mike, check the environment and shell variables.
​
```bash
export PRO=TECHPRO
sudo su
useradd mike # useradd is legacy command to create a user then it does not support to create the home-directory for the user etc.
passwd mike # give mike any password.
exit
su mike
env | grep PRO
set | grep TECHPRO
```
​
- Change the environment variable value.
​
```bash
export PRO=linux
env
export PRO=script
env
```
​
- Remove the environment variable with unset command.
​
```bash
export PRO=techproed
env | grep PRO
unset PRO
env | grep PRO
```
​
## Part 2 - Path Variable
​
- PATH variable.
​
```bash
printenv PATH
cd /bin
ls ca*    # see the cat command.
```
​
- Add a path to PATH variable for running a script FROM ANY WORKING DIRECTORY
​
```bash
cd
mkdir test && cd test
nano test.sh
# copy and paste the code-echo "hello world"- in test.sh
chmod +x test.sh
./test.sh
cd    # change directory to techpro's home directory
./test.sh    # it doesnt work. 
./test/test.sh
printenv PATH
cd test
pwd
export PATH=$PATH:/home/techpro/test
printenv PATH
cd
test.sh
cd /
test.sh
```
​
- Using the environment variable in the script.
​
```bash
cd test
export TECHPRO=env.var
PRO=shell.var
cd test
nano test1.sh
# copy and paste the code-echo "normally we should see env. variable $TECHPRO but probably we can't see the shell variable $PRO "
chmod +x test1.sh
./test1.sh
```
​
## Part 3 - Quoting with Variables.
​
- Double Quotes.
​
```bash
TECHVAR=my value
echo $TECHVAR
TECHVAR="my value"
echo $TECHVAR
MYNAME=ahmet
TECHVAR="my name is $MYNAME"
echo $TECHVAR
MYNAME="ahmet"
TECHVAR="hello $MYNAME"
echo $TECHVAR
TECHVAR="hello \$MYNAME"
echo $TECHVAR
```
​
- Single Quotes.
​
```bash
echo '$SHELL'
echo 'My\$SHELL'
```
